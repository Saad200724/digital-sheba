# Netlify Deployment Configuration

## Frontend Build
- Build Command: `npm run build`
- Publish Directory: `dist`

## Backend Support
Note: Netlify is primarily for static sites. To deploy this full-stack app on Netlify, you would typically:
1. Deploy the frontend to Netlify.
2. Deploy the backend (Express) to a service like Render, Fly.io, or Railway.
3. Update the frontend to point to the backend URL.

Alternatively, you can use Replit's built-in deployment for a unified full-stack experience.
